    "For this assignment, you will be writing a program that creates a panoramic mosaic from 2 or more images.  In general this technique should be applicable to any number of photographs.  The approach described below will work well for collective fields of up to 90 or even 120&deg;, but won't produce ideal results for large fields of view approaching or surpassing 180&deg;.  For large fields of view cylindrical or spherical projection is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we construct a panorama, we assume that all of the photographs were taken from the exact same location and that the images are related by pure rotation (no translation of the camera).  The easiest way to create the panorama is to project all of the photos onto a plane.  One photo must be selected (either manually or by your program) to be the base photo.  The other photos are aligned to this base photo by identifying a homography (a planar warp specified by 4 pairs of source/destination points) relating each pair.  Each of the other images is appropriately warped and composited onto the plane (the base image doesn’t need to be warped).\n",

    "### Part A: Find Interest Points/Descriptors in each Input Image\n",
    "We will be using OpenCV for this project, which you should already have installed.  However, you may need to install the contrib version--which comes seperate due to the SIFT algorithm being patented--by running the command:`pip install opencv-contrib-python`.  A good tutorial on how to use SIFT features in OpenCV is found [here](https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/da/df5/tutorial_py_sift_intro.html).  The first step to registering or aligning two images is to identify locations in each image that are distinctive or stand out.  The `sift.detectAndCompute()` routine produces both these interest points and their corresponding SIFT descriptors.  The first step of producing a panorama is to load all of the relevant images and find the interest points and their descriptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the red circles on each image below indicating the sift keypoints that were found (note that we downsampled the images to 600 x 600 pixels before extracting SIFT).  We scaled the circles according to the scale at which each keypoint was detected at.\n",

    "### Part B: Matching Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, given the features present in each image, you need to match the features so as to determine corresponding points between adjacent/overlapping images.  [This page](https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/dc/dc3/tutorial_py_matcher.html) provides details to do feature matching using `cv2.BFMatcher()`, analogous to the approach proposed by David Lowe in his original implementation.  Be aware that the resulting match is one directional.  You want to find putative pairs--pairs of points which are each other’s best match (e.g. there might be 3 points in image I1 for which a point q in image I2 are the best match, only one of these could be the best matching point p in I1 for that point q in I2).  In this part you need to compute the set of putative matches between each pair of images.\n",

Along with identifying the base image, you need to figure out the order in which you will composite the other images to the base.\n",

Four pairs of points (assuming no degeneracies) are sufficient to estimate the homography.  A more robust solution relying on more than four pairs can be obtained using least squares on the overconstrained linear system (solving $Ax = b$, where $x$ is a column vector with the 8 unknowns and you populate rows of $A$ and an entry of $b$ with the linear equations just described).
